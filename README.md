# Janney: Railway API Client for Node.js

_A **Janney Coupler** is a semi-automatic form of railway coupling that allow rail cars and locomotives to be securely linked together without rail workers having to get between the vehicles._

## Purpose

Railway's [API](https://docs.railway.com/reference/public-api) is GraphQL only. Many people in the Discord have asked about a client wrapper to abstract that layer away. (I love gql - but it's not fun to write if you're not used to it!)

This is a Node.js package exposing a simple client that takes an API token and exposes several methods for common operations.
